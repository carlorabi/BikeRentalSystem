# Bike Rental System

1. A full fledged bike rental system implemented in Python using object oriented programming.
2. Customers can see available bikes on the shop Rent bikes on hourly basis $5 per hour.Rent bikes on daily basis $20 per day.Rent bikes on weekly basis $60 per week. Family Rental, a promotion that can include from 3 to 5 Rentals (of any type) with a discount of 30% of the total priceThe rental shops canissue a bill when customer decides to return the bike.display available inventorytake requests on hourly, daily and weekly basis by cross verifying stockSince classes are used various customers and bike rental shops can be instantiated as needed.
3. For simplicity we assume that any customer requests rentals of only one type i.e hourly, monthly or weekly but is free to chose the number of bikes he/she wants. However requested bikes should be less than available stock.

# Unit-Test
To thoroughly check the classes and methods for faults, a test module is developed alongside the main software. The majority of mistakes are caused by non-integer inputs, negative values, and null values. The majority of them have been looked after.

# Aim and objectives
The primary goal of this course is to help students understand the fundamentals of Python programming and develop their ability to create programs in response to commands. A further goal of this curriculum is to teach students about Python data structures. To accomplish this goal, a deadline will be set for completing all work. Additionally, there will be additional research and study done in relation to this task.

# Purposed approach
To solve all the given work in this coursework, certain methodologies will be made which are follows.
1. At the primary, study and research will be done to take care of the issue of building up a program and its related point. 
2.  Then a program will be made in python which will coordinate the given instruction. 
3. Data structures required for composing the program will be chosen according to requirement of the given instruction of program.
4. An algorithm of the program will be built where everything the program wills be considered. 
5. A flowchart will be drawn to indicate how a code execute and work in the program. It is easy to understand how our program work in the real time.
6. Pseudocode will be made to demonstrate the normal understanding way of the program. It is look like a program but actual it is concept of program it does not execute. Pseudocode is just English language but structure is program. 
7. Finally, testing will be improved the situation the composed program so error and bugs will be settled and it can convey the right wanted outcome.

# Target audience
This task will be helpful for beginners, programmers, software engineers, analysts, and especially for students looking for premium education and who need to master the Python programming language. Additionally, it is helpful for those ads that suggest a billing system store that is necessary for each customer.

# Hardware and software requirements
Adjacent to PC, no an equipment is required however in programming we utilize python IDLE which ought to be installed in computer.

# Scope of the project 
This undertaking outlines the thoughts and techniques for composing programs in pythons utilizing loop concept. It additionally comprises algorithm, pseudocode, flowchart and data structure of the program. therefore, this undertaking will be extremely useful for every one of those understudies, programmer, software engineers and python learner students to discover how the code execute and work in the program. Similarly, It will instruct the strategy of different data structure which has been utilized as a part of the program. At last, as the program is composed with great clarification in each progression so it will help every one of those students who discover trouble in python.

# Features of the project
The features of this program are:
1. To build a program which work in loop statement and show accessible items which are stored in text file. The program should wait for user to enter purchase details of interest. Program should not close or stop until and unless the user chooses to do as such.
2. Program had user interacts features which is request every question with customer and react that answer provide by customer.
3. Program had exception handling feature which is used when unexpected entered from user. Like, program expect to the integer value from customer but customer entered a string value then program request for integer value.
4. Interconnect the different module in main module for easy to run the full program. Like, read, write, and purchase module are connect with main module.
5. Program can read text file and overwrite or write new text file. In this program, We used products.txt file for store a data and read and overwrite on it.
6. Similarly, program create a unique invoice in text file format and its naming from current device date and time.

# Discussion and analysis
This program was developed by using python official IDLE as name ‘Python IDLE’. In the overall program, We create a four-different module ‘read’, ‘write’, ‘purchase’ are connected to ‘main module’. All module has own work and finally main module call value and instruction from remaining three modules. In the processing of the program I used text file for read data and work on it. After the coding part of the program we also construct the flowchart for easier to understand how the program works. Flowchart is the graphical representation of the program, We construct the flowchart using the online tool which link is '[draw.io](www.draw.io "Draw.io Homepage")'

# Stepwise algorithm
- Step 1:	  Start 
- Step 2:	  products.txt file from given folder.
- Step 3:   txt file is displayed in the screen with products available.
- Step 4:	  Inputs customers name.
- Step 5: 	Inputs products name.
- Step 6: 	If product name is correct then go to next step or else remain in same step until valid name is provided.
- Step 7: 	Input quantity of the product.
- Step 8: 	If the input number of quantity is available then go to next step or else display Sorry!! a_name !, product is out of stock.
- Step 9: 	Ask customer do you want buy more products?(Y/N) If they select Y, go back to step 6, If they select no, then it won’t go to any steps.
- Step 10: 	Price of the product with total amount is displayed.
- Step 11:	Receipt is printed with customer name, date and time purchase. Products details, Grand total and at last Thank You customer for buying Let's Dough It! Pizza. See you again!
- Step 12: 	If more customers are there to purchase item ‘Y’ should be clicked and go to step or else end.
- Step 13:	 End.

# Conclusion
This coursework helped us to explore more in python programming language. We learned that python programming is a great degree valuable apparatuses to manufacture and create many projects and programming. The stock administration framework is valuable as it keeps the record of the item in the pizza store and in addition it causes client to screen their buy. 
From the overall coursework, it gives us knowledge about not only python programming language, flowchart and pseudocode also helps to Java programming language as well. This coursework is quite tough then I expect, In the first week of this coursework we feel it is easy to create a program as a requirement. But , this  is hard to finish. Finally, it happens good and program is also done with the help of teachers as well as senior friends.  
Hence indisputably, the coursework has been an amazing help to learn and get the more information about the python programming language. Moreover, it helped us in additionally creating distinctive different ability and educated numerous things which will help in my profession life in future. This undertaking has still got spaces for the change. At long last, I foresee accomplishing more undertakings in coming future.
